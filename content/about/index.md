I have been writing software for more than 15 years. Starting with BASIC on [ZX Spectrum][zx-spectrum] and Pascal on x86, moving onto full stack Java / J2EE / GWT and now focusing on Core Java / [Spring](https://spring.io) / Javascript and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react).

I believe in agility in software development, practicing <abbr title="Single responsibility, Open-closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation and Dependency inversion">[S.O.L.I.D.][solid]</abbr> and <dfn title="Test->Implementation->Refactoring">[Test-Driven Development][tdd]</dfn> with respect of <dfn title="Entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity">[Ockham's razor][ockham]</dfn> and <dfn title="For many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes">[Pareto][pareto]</dfn> principles.  

Currently I'm living in Limassol, Cyprus, contracting in financial industry.

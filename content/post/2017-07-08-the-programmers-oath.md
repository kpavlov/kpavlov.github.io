>**"In order to defend and preserve the honor of the profession of computer programmers,<br/>
>I Promise that, to the best of my ability and judgment:**
>
>1. [I will not produce harmful code.](https://youtu.be/Tng6Fox8EfI?t=38m6s)
>2. [The code that I produce will always be my best work.](https://youtu.be/Tng6Fox8EfI?t=40m55s) I will not knowingly allow code that is defective either in behavior or structure to accumulate.
>3. [I will produce, with each release, a quick, sure, and repeatable proof that every element of the code works as it should.](https://youtu.be/Tng6Fox8EfI?t=41m38s)
>4. [I will make frequent, small, releases so that I do not impede the progress of others.](https://youtu.be/Tng6Fox8EfI?t=43m36s)
>5. [I will fearlessly and relentlessly improve my creations at every opportunity. I will never degrade them.](https://youtu.be/Tng6Fox8EfI?t=44m42s)
>6. [I will do all that I can to keep the productivity of myself, and others, as high as possible. I will do nothing that decreases that productivity.](https://youtu.be/Tng6Fox8EfI?t=48m08s)
>7. [I will continuously ensure that others can cover for me, and that I can cover for them.](https://youtu.be/Tng6Fox8EfI?t=48m50s)
>8. [I will produce estimates that are honest both in magnitude and precision. I will not make promises without certainty.](https://youtu.be/Tng6Fox8EfI?t=51m09s)
>9. [I will never stop learning and improving my craft.](https://youtu.be/Tng6Fox8EfI?t=56m08s)"

## SSD Failure Rates

From Marc Prieur, of hardware.fr, here are the SSDs failures rates according to a French e-tailer as of October 2013:

- Samsung 0,28%
- Intel 0,63%
- Kingston 1,00%
- Corsair 1,88%
- Crucial 2,26%
- OCZ 2,27%

The failure rates are based on parts sold between October 1st 2012 and April 1st 2013, for returns before October 2013, which represents 6 months to one year of usage. The statistics per brand are based on a sample of at least 500 sales.

Do note that although these numbers donâ€™t paint the complete picture of world wide failure rates, but they are still an interesting sample to look at.

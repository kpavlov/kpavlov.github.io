- [Designing a Beautiful REST+JSON API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXYw4J4QOU) -- In this presentation, Les Hazlewood (@lhazlewood) - Stormpath CTO and Apache Shiro PMC Chair - will share all of the golden nuggets learned while designing, implementing and supporting JSON-based REST APIs, using examples from a clean real-world REST+JSON API built with Java technologies. He covers:
    - JSON-based data formats in a RESTful API

I've recently switched [logback](http://logback.qos.ch/) configuration of our application [from XML to Groovy](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/groovy.html).

Configuration file is not about 5 times smaller and can be displayed on one screen!

Groovy helped to remove duplicating parts of configurations by using for loop.

The moving was easy thanks to [online conversion tool](http://logback.qos.ch/translator/asGroovy.html).
And don't forget to add a groovy-all runtime dependency to your project config.

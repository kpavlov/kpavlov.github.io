When developing java web application it is often annoying to manage third-party javascript libraries. Especially, when it is necessary to upgrade some of them.

The project ["WebJars"][webjars] makes a life easier for such <del>lazy</del>efficient developers, like me :-)

There is a wide range of popular javascript libraries packaged int Jar archives and ready to be included as a dependencies into your project.
It is described in the [documentation][doc] how to configure resource mapping in a web framework of your choice.

[JetBrains Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is my favorite IDE and I love it! It has the most necessary features for java developer out-of-the-box. Even in Community Edition you'll find a lot of them! Difference between Community and Ultimate editions is with a set of plugins from JetBrains available. Native plugins are well tested and work like a charm, in contrast with Eclipse, where you have to do install/configure some extra plugins before you can start coding. I mean maven integrations (.m2eclipse).

For commercial plugins there are some free alternatives e.g. [Database Navigator](http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/CONTEST/Database+Navigator) for database support. There are some more free plugins useful both for Community and Ultimate editions.

Here is my list:
 - [Database Navigator](http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/CONTEST/Database+Navigator)
 - [RegexPlugin](http://www.intellij.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/RegexPlugin) -- very convenient RegExp editor/tester with regexp reference.
 - [BashSupport](http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/4230?pr=idea) if you need to write Bash scripts.
 - [Markdown](http://github.com/nicoulaj/idea-markdown) -- the Markdown language support.
 - [Line Sorter](https://github.com/syllant/idea-plugin-linessorter) and [Property Sorter](https://code.google.com/p/ideapropertysorterplugin/) plugins for managing file contents.
 - [Remote Synchronizer](https://github.com/syllant/idea-plugin-remotesynchronizer) for quick deployment and file synchronization over SFTP/FTP.
 - [Visual VM Launcher](https://github.com/krasa/VisualVMLauncher) to start your application from Idea with JVisualVM attached.

There are [1160 plugins](http://plugins.jetbrains.com/?idea_ce) available for Community Edition and [1250 plugins](http://plugins.jetbrains.com/?idea) for Ultimate Edition in the repository at the moment. I am sure you can add some plugins you love to this list.

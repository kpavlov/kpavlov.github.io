After playing with [`ui.grid`][ui.grid] I found [one more][angulargrid] library to impmenent grids in AngularJS - [angularGrid][angulargrid].

It's quite easy to integrate and faster than [ui.grid]. You may find other reasons of using this grid on the [author's post](http://www.angulargrid.com/why-the-world-needed-another-angularjs-grid/).

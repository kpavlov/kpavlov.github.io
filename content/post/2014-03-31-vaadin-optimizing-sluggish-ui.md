_Some receipts how to optimize Vaadin application._

> Is your Vaadin application becoming sluggish? Yes, this can happen - it is no secret.

For end users this is not acceptable, especially when building applications for frequent use.

I find especially useful advice by Stephen Borgelt to use [CssLayout](https://vaadin.com/book/-/page/layout.csslayout.html) wherever possible.

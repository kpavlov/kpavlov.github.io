# 1.  What is a cookie?
Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your device when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognises that cookie. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognise a user’s device. You can find more information about cookies at: [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org) and [www.youronlinechoices.eu](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu).

Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improve the user experience. They can also help to ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.

 

# 2.  How we use cookies
All of our web pages use "cookies". A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we place on your computer or mobile device if you agree. These cookies allow us to distinguish you from other users of our website, which helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and also allow us to improve our website.

* **Strictly necessary cookies** – these are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the website. Without these cookies the services that you have asked for, like online application forms, cannot be provided;
* **Performance cookies** – these cookies collect information about how visitors use a website, for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages.
